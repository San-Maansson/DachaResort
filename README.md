Hi all!
I'm currently working on creating a porfolio to showcase my works related to BI & Data Analytics using a mixed bag of Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI. This depository includes analytics sample of my hotel bookings from between 2011 - 2013. Some personal indentifiable data have been omitted to protect privacy. Currently WIP and more to come soon....
