Hi all!
I'm currently working on creating a porfolio to showcase my works related to BI & Data Analytics using a mixed bag of Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI. This project is a  sample of my hotel bookings, Dacha Resort, a small resort hotel in Phuket, Thailand, that I operated between 2011 - 2013. Some personal indentifiable data have been omitted to protect privacy.
